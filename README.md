# AI-Apache-Server-Intrusion-Detection-and-Avoidance

Decision tree based AI model that detects malicious actions on the network and adds them to a blacklist. This model utilizes the [classification and regression trees (CART)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics#Classification_and_regression_trees_.28CART.29), utilizing the Gini Index as the measure of impurity. The model has an accuracy of 94.5%.
